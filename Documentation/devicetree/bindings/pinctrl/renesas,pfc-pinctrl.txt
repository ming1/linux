* Renesas GPIO and Pin Mux/Config controller

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "renesas,pfc-r8a7740": for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) compatible pin-controller.
  - "renesas,pfc-r8a7779": for R8A7779 (R-Car H1) compatible pin-controller.
  - "renesas,pfc-sh7372": for SH7372 (SH-Mobile AP4) compatible pin-controller.
  - "renesas,pfc-sh73a0": for SH73A0 (SH-Mobile AG5) compatible pin-controller.

- reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the pin
  controller hardware module.

- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

- #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the pin number and the second cell
  is used to specify optional parameters as bit flags. Only the GPIO active low
  flag (bit 0) is currently supported.


The PFC node also acts as a container for pin control maps represented as
subnodes. Each subnode contains a function name and one or more pin or pin group
name. The subnode names are ignored, all subnodes are parsed through phandles
and processed purely based on their content.

Required Subnode Properties:
- renesas,pins : An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a pin or
  pin group.
- renesas,function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
  pin or pin group.

  Valid values for group and function names can be found in the group and
  function arrays of the PFC data file corresponding to the SoC
  (drivers/pinctrl/spear/pfc-*.c)

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the common
pinctrl bindings used by client devices.


The syntax of the gpio specifier used by client nodes should be the following
with values derived from the SoC user manual.

  <[phandle of the gpio controller node]
   [pin number within the gpio controller]
   [flags and pull up/down]>


Example 1: SH73A0 (SH-Mobile AG5) pin controller node

	gpio: pfc@e6050000 {
		compatible = "renesas,pfc-sh73a0";
		reg = <0xe6050000 0x8000>,
		      <0xe605801c 0x1c>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};

Example 2: A GPIO LED node that references a GPIO

	leds {
		compatible = "gpio-leds";
		led1 {
			gpios = <&gpio 20 1>; /* Active low */
		};
	};

Example 3: KZM-A9-GT (SH-Mobile AG5) default pin state and pin control maps
           for the LCD device

	&gpio {
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcd_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";

		lcd_pins: pfc_lcd_pins {
			renesas,pins = "lcd_data24", "lcd_sync";
			renesas,function = "lcd";
		};
	};
