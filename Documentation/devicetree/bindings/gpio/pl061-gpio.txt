ARM PL061 GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "arm,pl061", "arm,primecell"
- #gpio-cells : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
  second cell is used to specify optional parameters:
  - bit 0 specifies polarity (0 for normal, 1 for inverted)
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- interrupts : Interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller. Must
  be present if using gpios lines for interrupts.
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source.  The type shall be a <u32> and the value shall be 2.

  The 1st cell contains the interrupt number 0-7 corresponding to the gpio
  line.

  The 2nd cell is the flags, encoding trigger type and level flags.
	1 = low-to-high edge triggered
	2 = high-to-low edge triggered
	4 = active high level-sensitive
	8 = active low level-sensitive
