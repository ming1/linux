What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/reset_counters
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This write-only control file will zero all the statistical
		counters for UE and CE errors on the given memory controller.
		Zeroing the counters will also reset the timer indicating how
		long since the last counter were reset. This is useful for
		computing errors/time.  Since the counters are always reset
		at driver initialization time, no module/kernel parameter
		is available.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/seconds_since_reset
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays how many seconds have elapsed
		since the last counter reset. This can be used with the error
		counters to measure error rates.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/mc_name
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the type of memory controller
		that is being utilized.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/size_mb
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays, in count of megabytes, of memory
		that this memory controller manages.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ue_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the total count of uncorrectable
		errors that have occurred on this memory controller. If
		panic_on_ue is set, this counter will not have a chance to
		increment, since EDAC will panic the system

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ue_noinfo_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the number of UEs that have
		occurred on this memory controller with no information as to
		which DIMM slot is having errors.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ce_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the total count of correctable
		errors that have occurred on this memory controller. This
		count is very important to examine. CEs provide early
		indications that a DIMM is beginning to fail. This count
		field should be monitored for non-zero values and report
		such information to the system administrator.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ce_noinfo_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the number of CEs that
		have occurred on this memory controller wherewith no
		information as to which DIMM slot is having errors. Memory is
		handicapped, but operational, yet no information is available
		to indicate which slot the failing memory is in. This count
		field should be also be monitored for non-zero values.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/sdram_scrub_rate
Date:		February 2007
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Read/Write attribute file that controls memory scrubbing.
		The scrubbing rate used by the memory controller is set by
		writing a minimum bandwidth in bytes/sec to the attribute file.
		The rate will be translated to an internal value that gives at
		least the specified rate.
		Reading the file will return the actual scrubbing rate employed.
		If configuration fails or memory scrubbing is not implemented,
		the value of the attribute file will be -1.
