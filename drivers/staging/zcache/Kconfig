	  Zcache doubles RAM efficiency while providing a significant
	  performance boosts on many workloads.  Zcache uses
	  compression and an in-kernel implementation of transcendent
	  memory to store clean page cache pages and swap in RAM,
	  providing a noticeable reduction in disk I/O.

	  RAMster allows RAM on other machines in a cluster to be utilized
	  dynamically and symmetrically instead of swapping to a local swap
	  disk, thus improving performance on memory-constrained workloads
	  while minimizing total RAM across the cluster.  RAMster, like
	  zcache2, compresses swap pages into local RAM, but then remotifies
	  the compressed pages to another node in the RAMster cluster.
