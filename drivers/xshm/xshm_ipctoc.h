 * which points out the &xshm_ipctoc_channel. &xshm_ipctoc_channel defines
 * the channels used to communicate between host and external device (modem).
 *
 *  &xshm_ipctoc_channel can be used in packet-mode or stream-mode,
 *  and points out &xshm_bufidx holding information about cirular
 *  buffers, andtheir read/write indices etc.
