	  If you say yes here you get support for the ambient light sensor
	  interface on National Semiconductor / TI LM3533 Lighting Power
	  chips.

	  The sensor interface can be used to control the LEDs and backlights
	  of the chip through defining five light zones and three sets of
	  corresponding output-current values.

	  The driver provides raw and mean adc readings along with the current
	  light zone through sysfs. A threshold event can be generated on zone
	  changes. The ALS-control output values can be set per zone for the
	  three current output channels.
