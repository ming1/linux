This document explains how to debug a guests' kernel using KGDB.

1. Run the guest:
        'lkvm run -k [vmlinuz] -p "kgdboc=ttyS1 kgdbwait" --tty 1'

And see which PTY got assigned to ttyS1 (you'll see:
'  Info: Assigned terminal 1 to pty /dev/pts/X').

2. Run GDB on the host:
        'gdb [vmlinuz]'

3. Connect to the guest (from within GDB):
        'target remote /dev/pty/X'

4. Start debugging! (enter 'continue' to continue boot).
