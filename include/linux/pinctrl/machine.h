/**
 * struct pinctrl_map - boards/machines shall provide this map for devices
 * @dev_name: the name of the device using this specific mapping, the name
 *	must be the same as in your struct device*. If this name is set to the
 *	same name as the pin controllers own dev_name(), the map entry will be
 *	hogged by the driver itself upon registration
 * @name: the name of this specific map entry for the particular machine.
 *	This is the second parameter passed to pinmux_get() when you want
 *	to have several mappings to the same device
 * @ctrl_dev_name: the name of the device controlling this specific mapping,
 *	the name must be the same as in your struct device*
 * @function: a function in the driver to use for this mapping, the driver
 *	will lookup the function referenced by this ID on the specified
 *	pin control device
 * @group: sometimes a function can map to different pin groups, so this
 *	selects a certain specific pin group to activate for the function, if
 *	left as NULL, the first applicable group will be used
