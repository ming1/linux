 * struct shm_udchannel - Unidirectional channel for shm driver.
 *
 * @addr: Base address of the channel, address must be

 * @buffers: The number of buffers in the channel.
 * @ch_size: The size of data area for the channel in one direction.
 * @xfer_bit: GENI/O bit used when sending data (write pointer move)
 * @xfer_done_bit: GENI/O bit used to indicate avilable buffers
 *	(read pointer move).
 * @alignment: Alignment used in payload protocol.
 * @mtu: Maxium Transfer Unit used for packet in a buffer (Packet mode).
 * @packets: Maxium number of packets in a buffer (Packet mode).
 * @state: State of the device 0 - Closed, 1 - Open
 * @read: Specify the read index for a channel. In packed mode
 *	this index will at any time refer to the next buffer available for read.
 *	In stream mode, this will be the read index in the ring-buffer.
 * @write: Specify the write index for a channel. In packed mode
 *	this index will at any time refer to the next buffer available for
 *	write. In stream mode, this will be the write index in the ring-buffer.
 * @buf_size: In packet mode, this array contains the size of each buffer.
 *	In stream mode this is unused.
 *
 * This external shared memory channel configuration is exported from the
 * shm device. It gives the shm driver the necessary information for
 * running the shared memory protocol between modem and host.
 *
 * Note that two instances of this configuration is needed in order to run a
 * bi-directional channel.

 * @cfg: Configuration for the Channel
 * @state: State of the device: Closed - No user space client is using it,

 * @open: The driver calls open() when channel is taken into use.
 *	This function will fail if channel configuration is inconsistent,
 *	or upon resource conflicts with other channels.
 *
 * @open_cb: The device calls open_cb() when is ready for use.
 *
 * @close: Called by the driver when a channel is no longer in use.
 *
 * @close_cb: The device calls close_cb() to notify about remote side closure.
 *
 * @ipc_tx_release_cb: This callback is triggered by the modem when a
 *	transmit operation has completed and the buffer can be reused.
 *	This function must be set by the driver upon device registration.

 *	after this call to ipc_tx_release_cb().
 *
 * @ipc_rx_cb: The driver gets this callback when the modem sends a buffer
 *	from the modem. The driver must call ipc_rx_release()
 *	to make the buffer available again when the received buffer has been
 *	processed.
 *	This function pointer must be set by the driver upon device
 *	registration.
 *
 * @ipc_rx_release: Called by the driver when a RX operation has completed
 *	and that the rx-buffer is released.
 *
 * @ipc_tx: Called by the driver when a TX buffer shall be sent to the modem.
 *
 * @driver_data: pointer to driver specific data.

 * external shared memory can bused (e.g. C2C or DPRAM).
 *
 * This structure is used by the shm device representing the
 * External Shared Memory.
 *
 * The this structure contains configuration data for the shm device and
 * functions pointers for IPC communication between Linux host and modem.
 * The external shared memory protocol memory e.g. C2C or DPRAM
 * together is a IPC mechanism for transporting small commands such as
 * Mailbox or GENI/O.
 *
 * This data structure is initiated by the shm device, except
 * for the functions ipc_rx_cb() and ipc_tx_release_cb(). They must be set by
 * the shm-driver when device is registering.
